# Credit Card Fraud Detection Dashboard ðŸ“Š

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a simulated **Credit Card Transactions dataset** to detect and visualize fraud patterns. The dataset contains **555,719 transactions** with 23 columns and highlights fraud trends by **day, month, state, category, customer, job role, age group, and transaction amount levels**. The goal is to identify high-risk customers, transactions, and regions to improve fraud monitoring and decision-making.

ðŸ—‚ **Dataset Source:** Kaggle â€“ Synthetic dataset generated using Sparkov.  
**Structure:** Single large transaction table with customer, product, and transaction details.  
**Record Count:** 555,719 transactions.

ðŸ›  **Tools & Technologies**  
- **SQL Server / T-SQL:** Data cleaning, type conversions, null handling, and exploratory queries.  
- **Power BI:** Multi-page dashboard creation with relationships, KPIs, visualizations, and interactive slicers.  
- **Python (optional):** Data wrangling, type conversions, and exporting clean CSV files.  

ðŸ§¹ **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
- Converted columns to proper data types (e.g., float â†’ decimal, nvarchar â†’ nchar).  
- Standardized categorical values (merchant, job, gender).  
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns (e.g., `unix_time`).  
- Created additional columns: `age`, `age_group`, `amt_group`, and `full_name`.  
- Handled missing latitude/longitude carefully to avoid loss of valid location data.  

ðŸ“ˆ **Key Insights**
- **Total Transactions:** 555,719  
- **Fraud Count:** 2,145 (less than 1%)  
- **Total Transaction Amount:** $38.56M  
- **Unique Credit Card Holders:** 924  
- **Fraud by State:** Highest in New York (175 cases)  
- **Fraud by Category:** Online payments (`shopping_net`) and POS payments (`grocery_pos`) highest  
- **Customer Behavior:** Seniors commit most fraud; low-amount transactions dominate  
- **Fraud Trends:** Peaks from July to November; highest daily fraud on 4th October
